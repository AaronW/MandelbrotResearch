This program is intended to be an investigation into the claimed efficiency and ease of use of Apple's Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), which is also available on non-apple operating systems under the name libdispatch.h

My libdispatch implementation is NOT currently in the project.  I'm working on getting the framework and other implementations up and running first.
