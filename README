This program is intended to be an investigation into the claimed efficiency and ease of use of Apple's Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), which is also available on non-apple operating systems under the name libdispatch.h

The program generates a PPM file at the location specified by the *fp pointer.  For now, users must manually modify this hard coded string to save the file to a proper location on their own machine.
