This program is intended to be an investigation into the claimed efficiency and ease of use of Apple's Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), which is also available on non-apple operating systems under the name libdispatch.h

I've recently added support for libdispatch in my program, though it is not 100% correct.  Currently generating over 99% accurate matrices when using 640x480 or 1024x768 dimensions.
